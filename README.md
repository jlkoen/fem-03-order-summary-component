## My process

I built this with React (using Vite) and TailwindCSS. I wanted to follow a workflow that is more application building than just editing a HTML file.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- TailwindCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I used this project to help build muscle memory when it comes to creating a component from scratch. It gave me the style guide and I worked through the component step-by-step.

### Continued development

For future projects I want to include various component libraries like ShadCN/UI, especially for the more complex designs.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - I used this to reference the syntax for the various utility classes of Tailwind.This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) - This is a great VSCode extension to add IntelliSense while writing Tailwind classes.
